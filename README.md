# CNN Binary Classifier - Cat vs Dog

A deep learning application that classifies images of cats and dogs using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) built with PyTorch. The application features a user-friendly Streamlit web interface and is containerized with Docker for easy deployment.

## Features

- **Custom CNN Architecture**: Designed specifically for binary classification of cats and dogs
- **Web Interface**: Interactive Streamlit app for easy image uploads and predictions
- **Docker Support**: Containerized application for consistent deployment
- **Data Augmentation**: Comprehensive data preprocessing and augmentation for robust training
- **Model Persistence**: Save and load trained models
- **Real-time Predictions**: Fast inference with confidence scores

## Architecture

The CNN model consists of:
- 4 Convolutional layers with batch normalization
- Max pooling for spatial dimension reduction
- Dropout layers for regularization
- 3 Fully connected layers for classification
- Input: 224x224 RGB images
- Output: Binary classification (Cat/Dog) with confidence scores

## Quick Start

### Using Docker (Recommended)

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/lolyhop/cnn-binary-classifier.git
   cd cnn-binary-classifier
   ```

2. **Build and run with Docker Compose:**
   ```bash
   docker-compose up --build
   ```

3. **Access the application:**
   Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:8501`

### Local Development

1. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

2. **Prepare your data** (optional, for training):
   ```
   data/
     train/
       cats/
         cat1.jpg
         cat2.jpg
         ...
       dogs/
         dog1.jpg
         dog2.jpg
         ...
   ```

3. **Train the model** (optional):
   ```bash
   python train.py
   ```

4. **Run the Streamlit app:**
   ```bash
   streamlit run app.py
   ```

## Usage

### Web Interface

1. **Upload an Image**: Click the file uploader and select an image of a cat or dog
2. **View Prediction**: The model will automatically classify the image and show:
   - Predicted class (Cat üê± or Dog üê∂)
   - Confidence score
   - Probability distribution
3. **Interpret Results**: Higher confidence scores indicate more certain predictions

### Training Your Own Model

If you have your own dataset:

1. **Organize your data** in the following structure:
   ```
   data/
     train/
       cats/
         [cat images]
       dogs/
         [dog images]
   ```

2. **Run the training script:**
   ```bash
   python train.py
   ```

3. **Monitor training progress** - the script will show:
   - Training and validation loss
   - Training and validation accuracy
   - Best model checkpoints

## Model Performance

The model uses several techniques to achieve good performance:

- **Data Augmentation**: Random flips, rotations, and color jittering
- **Batch Normalization**: Faster training and better convergence
- **Dropout**: Prevents overfitting
- **Learning Rate Scheduling**: Adaptive learning rate for optimal training
- **Early Stopping**: Saves the best performing model
